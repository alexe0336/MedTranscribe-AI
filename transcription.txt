Doctor: Good morning, Mrs. Smith. How are you feeling today?

Patient: Good morning, Dr. Johnson. I've been feeling a bit under the weather lately.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?

Patient: Sure. I've been having a persistent cough for the past week, and I've also felt quite fatigued.

Doctor: I see. Have you had any fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain?

Patient: I had a low-grade fever a couple of days ago, but no chest pain or shortness of breath.

Doctor: Alright. Have you had any changes in your appetite or any weight loss?

Patient: Not really. My appetite has been normal.

Doctor: Okay. I'll take a listen to your lungs and check your throat. Please take a deep breath for me.

Doctor examines the patient.

Doctor: Your lungs sound clear, but your throat looks a bit inflamed. It might be a viral infection. I'll recommend some rest, plenty of fluids, and over-the-counter medication for your cough.

Patient: Thank you, Dr. Johnson. Is there anything else I should be doing?

Doctor: Just make sure to monitor your symptoms. If you develop a high fever or have any trouble breathing, come back to see me right away.

Patient: Will do. Thank you so much.

Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, Mrs. Smith.Oh, can
